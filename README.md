# Relative_robot
You are an evil robot living in a spaceship float somewhere unknown in the universe. 
One day your usually harmless water balloon somehow got out of the safe voult and started floating around!
If the water balloon hits something in the spaceship, it might explode into floating water drops and ruin the spaceship!
Can you successfully move the waterballoon back to the vault, or will you go down with the spaceship? 
It's up for you to decide!

##direction to run the game:
1. download and unzip space_bot.zip
2. go to directory Documents/processing
3. copy space_bot folder into processing directory
4. open processing, go to file -> open, and open space_bot.pde
5. if there's syntax error (red lines under code), go to Sketch -> Import Library and import library fisica
6. the program should run now

##Rules: 
1. use up, down, left and right key to accelerate the robot/spaceship in different directions. Note that when the spaceship accelerate to say the right, the ball isn’t! What’s going to happen?

2. click shift to shift control between robot and spaceship

3. the robot would be attached to the spaceship once the control is passed to the spaceship(in the current version)

4. the robot battery will drop by one every time you press a direction button. Once the battery goes to 0, you die. You can get your robot recharged at the recharge station

5. the door that blocks the way of the water balloon will disappear once the robot reaches the door button the same color as the door. Try to make your robot open all the doors without running out of battery!

6. have fun!
